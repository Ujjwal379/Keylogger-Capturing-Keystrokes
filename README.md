## *Ujjwal Gupta*

**Keylogger System** highlights the basic essentials of the keylogging system and captures the keystrokes of the user in real-time which stores data in a readable decrypted format(.json, .txt format) 

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Functionality

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] Keycapturing takes place as soon as message as a input provided by user
* [x] All details regarding message keystrokes and decryption is captured
* [x] The decrypted message is presented in both .json and .txt fornat


## Notes

Encountering small bugs which reduces the keylogger system efficiency would be a challenging process.
